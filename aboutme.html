    <h1>Hi there, my name is Sky/Skylar.</h1>
    <h2> York Tech </h2>
    <p>I am a networking and cybersecurity major at York Tech. I am working towards obtaining my CompTIA ITF certification and Network+ certification. I love creating things on my computers and have 8 years of experience with Windows and computers overall. This code was created in my HTML Class. Networking is more my thing. </p>
<h3> The Full Story</h3>
<p2> I have been playing with computers since a very young age. Since I was able to understand the world around me. My dad's computer at the time was a HP Pavlion that had 2GB  of DDR 2 running Windows XP Home Edition. I remember playing that Pinbal game everyone talked about. I grew up also with Windows 7, 8 (Sadly) 10, and Windows 11. </p2>
<p3> The way I started with computers was the ol break it and find out what happens. And that exactly what I did. </p3>
